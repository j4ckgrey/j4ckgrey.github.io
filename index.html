      <p class="lh-lg fst-normal font-monospace text-center text-white fs-5">Hello! My name is Khaled, originally from Egypt, where I studied the metal industry as an AutoCAD designer. My journey in the tech world began with a fascination for how things work, leading me to explore various fields related to computer science.
      In 2012, I enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science in Calabria, Italy. Although my initial attempts did not yield the success I hoped for, I took some time away from formal education to reflect on my career path. After a few gap years, I reignited my passion for computer science and made a commitment to pursue it wholeheartedly.
      From 2020 to 2023, I applied my background in engineering here in Germany, working as a quality assurance specialist and programmer on a CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine). This experience allowed me to blend my technical knowledge with practical applications in quality control.
      In 2023, I completed an intensive 12-week web development bootcamp, where I honed my skills in building dynamic and responsive web applications. Currently, I am furthering my education in advanced software engineering studies in Cologne, Germany.
      I have experience with a variety of programming languages, both on the front end and back end, including C++, Ruby, PHP, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with databases such as SQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and I am comfortable using Git for version control.
      I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to applying my skills to create innovative solutions in the tech industry!
